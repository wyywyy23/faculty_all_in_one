\section{Mentoring}
My mentoring philosophy extends beyond sharing knowledge and offering intellectual advices. I am dedicated to providing holistic support for the academic and professional development of the students. I aim to create a supportive and collaborative research environment, inspiring students to excel in their studies, uphold professionalism, and explore their own research interests until they emerge as independent researchers. My time as a postdoc at Columbia allowed me to partially implement this philosophy, guiding several Ph.D. students to significant milestones, including publishing their first papers as lead authors at premier conferences like OFC and CLEO, and securing their initial industry positions. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to extend and refine my mentorship practices at the \appSchool{}.

\section{Post\textendash COVID-19 Considerations}

In the post\textendash COVID-19 era, I have adapted to the new normal of hybrid teaching and research settings. I am prepared to refine my teaching and mentoring approaches to accommodate the new challenges. For example, I plan to equip my slides with more annotations and necessary animations, compensating for the absence of real-time interactions in front of a physical whiteboard. Additionally, I plan to introduce regular coffee hours and/or lunch meetings within the group to facilitate in-person discussion whenever feasible and in compliance with the university guidelines. Such adaptability is critical for navigating through the evolving educational landscape, and I am committed to the continuous innovation in my teaching and mentoring practices to provide all students with accessible and effective education.
