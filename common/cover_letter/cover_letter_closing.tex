My training in California and New York has enriched me with diverse and inclusive academic experiences, fueling my passion to contribute to the \appSchool{}'s community through not only research, but also teaching, mentoring, and outreach. As a teaching assistant and guest lecturer, I have taught at both undergraduate and graduate levels, focusing my teaching philosophy on the balance of engagement, conveyance, and inspiration through visualization. I also value the role of mentoring in fostering students' intellectual growth beyond technical skills and have actively mentored students tailored to their research interests and career aspirations. My advocacy for diversity and inclusion is reflected in my experiences of working with\textemdash as well as my efforts to promote the accessibility of STEM education to\textemdash underrepresented groups in my endeavors.

I am enthusiastic about joining the \appDept{} at the \appSchool{} to further its excellence in research and education. Enclosed are my application materials, and I am glad to provide additional information if required. I look forward to the possibility of discussing my qualifications and research vision with you. Thank you for considering my application, and I anticipate your response.
