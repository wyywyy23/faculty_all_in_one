Traffic demands in data centers and high-performance computing systems have surged over the past decade, primarily fueled by the rapid expansion of data-intensive applications in the areas of machine learning, big data analytics, and particularly deep learning\textendash driven artificial intelligence (AI). The remarkable capabilities recently exhibited by large language models in natural language processing and creative content generation have further propelled technological progress toward the adoption of ever-larger models and datasets. This ongoing trend has ignited substantial efforts to enhance computational hardware capabilities, notably via increased parallelism and heterogeneity, yet outpacing the evolution of the underlying communication infrastructure. Consequently, moving massive data off and across chips has emerged as a major bottleneck, limiting both the performance and energy efficiency of computing systems and posing a significant challenge to their continued scaling. Tackling this grand challenge, my research seeks \textbf{transformative connectivity solutions} harnessing the potential of integrated silicon photonics.
