  abstract      = {The diversity of workload requirements and increasing hardware heterogeneity in emerging high performance computing (HPC) systems motivate resource disaggregation. Resource disaggregation allows compute and memory resources to be allocated individually as required to each workload. However, it is unclear how to efficiently realize this capability and cost-effectively meet the stringent bandwidth and latency requirements of HPC applications. To that end, we describe how modern photonics can be co-designed with modern HPC racks to implement flexible intra-rack resource disaggregation and fully meet the bit error rate (BER) and high escape bandwidth of all chip types in modern HPC racks. Our photonic-based disaggregated rack provides an average application speedup of 11\% (46\% maximum) for 25 CPU and 61\% for 24 GPU benchmarks compared to a similar system that instead uses modern electronic switches for disaggregation. Using observed resource usage from a production system, we estimate that an iso-performance intra-rack disaggregated HPC system using photonics would require 4x fewer memory modules and 2x fewer NICs than a non-disaggregated baseline.},

  abstract  = {The growth of artificial intelligence applications demands ever larger and more complex deep learning models, dominating today's{\textemdash}and tomorrow's{\textemdash}data center and high-performance computing systems. While traditional electronics are failing to keep pace with application demands, silicon photonic (SiPh) interconnects have emerged as a necessary technology to support these systems. SiPh-driven wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) offers a particularly promising path toward supporting incredibly high-aggregate link bandwidth in a compact and efficient form factor. One of the basic building blocks of these integrated WDM interconnects is the SiPh resonator. Their inherent wavelength selectivity and compact footprint allow for efficient data transmission multiplexed across dozens of carrier wavelengths. Used as add-drop (AD) filters, SiPh resonators are critical to constructing integrated tunable wavelength-selective optical circuit switches as well as for demultiplexing the different carrier wavelengths toward independent wavelength-insensitive photodiodes in a dense wavelength-division multiplexing receiver. Resonators in the all-pass (AP) configuration are widespread as well, allowing for wavelength-selective modulation to drive aggregate link bandwidths far beyond the individual channel data rate. Unlike SiPh Mach{\textendash}Zehnder modulators (MZM), resonant modulators can be driven using low, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor drive voltages, allowing for tight co-integration between photonic integrated circuits, fabricated with larger process node technologies, and electronic integrated circuits, designed to exploit the advantages of the latest node. To push toward practical peta-scale interconnects, a comprehensive review of SiPh resonators is required, addressing bottlenecks and design constraints at both the architecture and device levels. We first describe the predominant integrated link architectures and identify their limits. We then discuss the device-level design considerations that can be made for both AD and AP configuration resonators to overcome the system level limits with novel resonator device designs. Analytical models and numerical simulation of resonators are validated by experimental measurement of devices fabricated in a commercial 300-mm foundry, showing a clear path toward volume manufacturing. The demonstrated resonant modulators and filters support the feasibility of increasing the aggregate bandwidth of resonator-driven SiPh interconnects into the peta-scale regime.},

  abstract  = {The explosive growth of data volume brought by the pervasiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) applications is calling for interconnect technologies that enable higher bandwidth capacity at a lower cost. In particular, optical interconnects based on silicon photonics are considered a promising substitute for electrical ones, given their cost-effectiveness and scalability enabled by a CMOS-compatible fabrication process. However, as the optical interconnects further penetrate the shorter-reach regime, several issues arise from the growing complexity of system integration and pose challenges to their design quality, including 1) inadequate support from design automation methodologies for the modeling and simulation of the optical interconnects, 2) oversimplified characterization of process variations, resulting in variation alleviation techniques with limited effectiveness, and 3) the lack of runtime reconfiguration strategies for the optical interconnects under traffic dynamics, leading to unoptimized energy efficiency. This dissertation is devoted to addressing the above issues by solutions proposed at the device, link, and system levels, paving the way to the quality design of variation-aware runtime-reconfigurable optical interconnects with optimized energy efficiency. The first part of this dissertation focuses on device-level methodologies for electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA), including compact models developed for lasers and modulators and a novel hierarchical spatial variation model characterized for silicon microring resonators. Extensively validated by measurement data, the library of device-level models enables accurate circuit-level simulation of optical links and variation-aware estimation of the link power budget, serving as the fundamentals of the optimization techniques proposed at the link and system levels. The second part of this dissertation proposes three link-level techniques to improve the energy efficiency of the optical interconnects under wafer-scale process variations. The three techniques exploit, respectively, 1) sub-channel redundancy of carrier wavelengths, 2) a combination of electrical and thermal tuning mechanisms, and 3) optimal mixing and matching of a batch of fabricated transceivers, achieving significant reductions in the energy required for transmitting a single bit of data. The third and final part of this dissertation proposes two strategies at the system level that further improve the energy efficiency of the optical interconnects under traffic dynamics by reconfiguring the link power at application runtime. The two strategies incorporate assistance from 1) traffic adjustment enabled by task mapping exploration and 2) traffic adaptability enabled by traffic prediction, respectively, and achieve substantial improvements in energy consumption with minimal overhead to application execution time, notably outperforming existing strategies.},
